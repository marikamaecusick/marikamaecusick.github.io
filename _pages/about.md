I am a second year PhD student in [Health Policy](https://healthpolicy.fsi.stanford.edu/) with a specialization in Decision Sciences at Stanford University, primarily advised by [Doug Owens](https://healthpolicy.fsi.stanford.edu/people/douglas_k_owens), [Jeremy Goldhaber-Fiebert](https://healthpolicy.fsi.stanford.edu/people/jeremy_goldhaberfiebert), and [Sherri Rose](http://drsherrirose.org/). 

Prior to Stanford, I graduated from Cornell University with a BA in major in Statistical Science and a minor in East Asian Studies. I also earned a MS in Information Science for Health Tech from Cornell Tech based in NYC. After my Master's degree, I worked as a business analyst for the Research Informatics Division at Weill Cornell Medicine.
