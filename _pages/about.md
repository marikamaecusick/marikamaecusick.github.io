I am a second year PhD student in Health Policy with a specialization in decision sciences at Stanford, primarily advised by Doug Owens, Jeremy Goldhaber-Fiebert, and Sherri Rose. 

Prior to Stanford, I graduated from Cornell University with a BA in major in statistical science and a minor in East Asian Studies. I also earned a MS in Information Science for Health Tech from Cornell Tech based in NYC. After my master's degree, I worked as a business analyst for the Research Informatics Division at Weill Cornell Medicine.
